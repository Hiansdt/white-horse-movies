        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>This website has been made for academic purposes only. The idea is that you'll come with a feeling, whatever it is, and then be presented with 7 feeling squares and a daily quote. You'll select the square that best describes your current state, and then you'll be presented with a quote and a good movie recommendation, all based on the feeling you selected. So that if you're sad, you can ease it. If you're angry, you can forget it. If you're happy, you can keep it, and so on...</p>
